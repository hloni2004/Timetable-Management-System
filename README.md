# Timetable-Management-System
timetable project for our second year 
In my second year, my team and I developed a timetable management system for our faculty to address scheduling conflicts. The system was designed to prevent errors where multiple classes were mistakenly allocated to the same time slot, causing confusion. Our solution aimed to streamline scheduling and improve overall timetable accuracy.
